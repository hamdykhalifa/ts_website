# ts_website

This website is a responsive webpage for my friend who is a physiotherapist.

It is one page website with different sections, each of those sections are animated with jquery and the aos library. 
By using the AOS library, giving the website an exciting touch was pretty easy to do.

# Contact options

Currently he hasn't decided yet if he wants to really have a contact form setup. 
If so: a further step would be to setup a contact form with node.js and express.js, sending contact requests directly to his mail address.
